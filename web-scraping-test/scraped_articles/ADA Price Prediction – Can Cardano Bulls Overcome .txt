Article Title: ADA Price Prediction – Can Cardano Bulls Overcome This Key Hurdle

Article Text:
Cardano (ADA) is attempting a fresh increase above the $0.4500 resistance zone. ADA could gain bullish momentum if it settles above the 100 SMA (H4).
In the past few days, Cardano started a recovery wave from the $0.4180 zone, like Bitcoin and Ethereum. ADA price broke the $0.4350 and $0.4420 levels to move into a short-term bullish zone.
There was a move above the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5227 swing high to the $0.4180 low. Besides, there was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $0.4580 on the 4-hour chart of the ADA/USD pair.
Cardano is now trading below $0.480 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). On the upside, immediate resistance is near the $0.4650 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
The first resistance is near $0.470 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $0.5227 swing high to the $0.4180 low. The next key resistance might be $0.4980. If there is a close above the $0.4980 resistance, the price could start a strong rally.

In the stated case, the price could rise toward the $0.5250 region. Any more gains might call for a move toward $0.5650.
If Cardano’s price fails to climb above the $0.470 resistance level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours), it could start another decline. Immediate support on the downside is near the $0.450 level.
The next major support is near the $0.4350 level. A downside break below the $0.4350 level could open the doors for a test of $0.4180. The next major support is near the $0.3880 level.
