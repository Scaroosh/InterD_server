Moreover, the DOc crypto highlights that the price has dipped from $11.50 to $10.05 in less than 24 hours on the price chart. He further stated that three major events have caused the drop in RNDR in the last 24 hours. The reasons were that BTC fell from $63,500 to $61,500, liquidity shifted from utility to meme coins token, hence meme coin started to lift again, and lastly, the whales are dumping a lot of RNDR, probably for the conversion of profits into meme-coins.

The DOc crypto also shared the opinion that it seems like a healthy correction, as money moving into meme coins are a way to gain liquidity for the next altcoin season.
The overall trend is strongly bullish and witnessed an enormous positive change in a year. It seems that the RNDR price has failed to sustain the $11 hurdle and melted down to the 20-day exponential moving average.
In a situation, if the RNDR price manages to sustain over the previous candlestick then it may continue the bullish trend.
On the other hand, if the RNDR asset price plunges below the 20-day EMA, then sellers may have an eye for the major support level of the $7 price mark. Likewise, if the RNDR price begins trading below the major support level, most of the investors may prefer to book profit which may end up in massive selling pressure.
At the time of writing, the RNDR price traded at $10.18 with an intraday loss of 10%. The market capitalization is $3.96 Billion, and the 24-hour trading volume is $484.13 Million. The circulating supply is 388,643,224 RNDR, and the total supply is 532,070,164 RNDR.
