This whale bought 12,427 ETH on Poloniex at an average price of $11. Now, they are selling 4,153 ETH at $2,984 per coin â€“ that is whopping 27,027.27% growth. The ETH they sent to Coinbase is now worth more than $12 million in fiat.

The above-mentioned source, Whale Alert, also noticed two old Bitcoin wallets coming back to life after a staggering period of dormancy. Both were last active almost eleven years ago, in 2013 â€“ that is two years after mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto chose to disappear from the public space. Before he disappeared, he left BTC in the hands of enthusiastic developers.
Each of these wallets contained 500 Bitcoins evaluated at $30,514,975 and $30,494,084. The whalesâ€™ potential profit has increased by an astounding 49,274%.
