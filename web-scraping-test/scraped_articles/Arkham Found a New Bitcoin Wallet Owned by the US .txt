Article Title: Arkham Found a New Bitcoin Wallet Owned by the US Government! How Much BTC Is In It

Article Text:
Investors are curious about the BTC and altcoin portfolios of giant corporate companies that affect the Bitcoin price with their Bitcoin purchases and sales or moves, and especially the US Government, which is very effective on the price.
At this point, the cryptocurrency analysis company Arkham, which previously detected the Bitcoin wallets of Elon Musk's giant companies Tesla and Spacex, has now detected a new BTC wallet of the US Government.
Accordingly, Arkham identified the address where the Bitcoins seized by the US government from drug dealer Banmeet Singh during a hearing in January this year were located.
According to Arkham data, this address contains 3.94 thousand BTC (worth approximately $251 million).
Including the Bitcoins in the last detected wallet, the US government currently holds 216,811 thousand BTC (worth approximately $13.83 billion).
