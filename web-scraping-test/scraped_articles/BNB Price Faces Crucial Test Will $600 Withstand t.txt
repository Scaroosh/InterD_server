Article Title: BNB Price Faces Crucial Test Will $600 Withstand the Pressure

Article Text:
BNB price is attempting a fresh increase from the $540 zone. The price must settle above the $600 resistance to gain bullish momentum.
After forming a base above the $535 level, BNB price started a fresh increase. There was a steady increase above the $565 and $575 resistance levels, like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
The bulls pushed the price above the $580 pivot level and the 61.8% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $618 swing high to the $5382 low. It is now trading above $590 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
There is also a key bullish trend line forming with support at $592 on the 4-hour chart of the BNB/USD pair. The pair seems to be consolidating near the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward move from the $618 swing high to the $5382 low.
Immediate resistance is near the $602 level. The next resistance sits near the $618 level. A clear move above the $618 zone could send the price further higher.

In the stated case, BNB price could test $635. A close above the $635 resistance might set the pace for a larger increase toward the $650 resistance. Any more gains might call for a test of the $680 level in the coming days.
If BNB fails to clear the $602 resistance, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $592 level and the trend line.
The next major support is near the $578 level. The main support sits at $555. If there is a downside break below the $555 support, the price could drop toward the $530 support. Any more losses could initiate a larger decline toward the $520 level.
