Article Title: BREAKING Giant Trading Company Susquehanna International Group Announces It Holds More Than $1 Billion in Bitcoin ETFs

Article Text:
According to breaking information, Susquehanna International Group reported holdings of more than $1 billion in Bitcoin ETFs in its latest portfolio update.
Susquehanna International Group is known as a privately owned, global business and technology company.
The firm was founded in 1987 by six entrepreneurs, including Arthur Dantchik and Jeff Yass. It has generated $7.2 billion in revenue by 2024 and employs more than 3,000 people in offices in North America, Australia, Europe and Asia. The US-based company thus joined the caravan of companies that own over $1 billion worth of Bitcoin, although not in physical form.
It is not known when the company made these purchases, but Grayscale had started to see positive fund flows in recent days.
The data shows that the vast majority of his company's purchases involve Grayscale's GBTC product.
