Article Title: BREAKING JPMorgan, Largest Bank in the US, Announces It Owns Bitcoin Spot ETF Holdings

Article Text:
JPMorgan, the largest US bank, owns approximately $1 million worth of Bitcoin Spot ETF shares, according to a filing with the SEC.
This statement comes despite the bank's CEO Jamie Dimon having previously expressed strong anti-Bitcoin views.
Dimon has expressed skepticism towards Bitcoin, going so far as to call it a “ponzi scheme” and “a scam with no future as a currency.” He has consistently advised investors to stay away from the volatile digital asset.
However, the latest statement shows a divergence between the CEO's personal views and the bank's investment strategies. JPMorgan Chase is an authorized participant in Blackrock's spot Bitcoin ETF, a stark contrast to Dimon's public stance on cryptocurrency.
