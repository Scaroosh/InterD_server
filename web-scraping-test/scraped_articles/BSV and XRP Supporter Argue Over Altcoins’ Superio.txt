Article Title: BSV and XRP Supporter Argue Over Altcoins’ Superiority

Article Text:
A prominent crypto user identified as Mr. Huber on X has engaged an XRP critic in a debate. Point by point, Mr. Huber attempted to debunk the points raised by Tony, an acclaimed crypto enthusiast, showing how his preferred cryptocurrency, BSV isn’t a better option than XRP.
Every metric? My shitcoin is up 1000% against BSV. And its xrp – so it's crazy if you really think about it. 90% down against xrp. Damn! https://t.co/rjx8oKmNsP pic.twitter.com/gX7PM3lAoc
In one of his posts, Tony implied that BSV is better than XRP by every metric, claiming that “fraudulent Tether money” sustains the altcoin. The BSV supporter stated that XRP can only do 200 transactions per second (TPS) unsustainably. Furthermore, he claimed that Teranode has been running BSV at millions of TPS for six months without interruption.
In his response, Mr. Huber replied that BSV is not better than XRP by “every metric.” He shared that a coin in his portfolio has performed 1,000 times better than BSV in price. He further highlighted that BSV is down 90% against XRP.
In further debate, Tony insisted that XRP maxis have no place to comment on price action. According to him, Ripple holds half of XRP’s supply and dumps it on users monthly. In comparison, he claimed that BSV is scarce, with a recognizable use case.

To this argument, Mr. Huber replied with a similar point to the previous post. This time, he asked Tony to explain why BSV is down by over 90% against XRP, citing the XRP critic’s claim that the altcoin has no use.
BSV and XRP have experienced bearish pressure recently, with BSV’s bear trend showing more severity. The Bitcoin fork traded for $62.49 at the time of writing, reflecting a 51% drop in the past month, according to data from TradingView. Meanwhile, XRP has lost 30.64% during the same period to trade for $0.5191, per TradingView.
