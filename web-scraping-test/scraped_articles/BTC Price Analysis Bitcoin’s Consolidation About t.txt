On the daily chart, it is evident that the Bitcoin price has been consolidating inside a large descending channel. The midline of the channel has recently rejected the price to the downside, and the market is testing the $60K level once again.
If this level breaks, there is a high probability for the channel also to break down, and the price will be more likely to experience a massive drop toward the $52K support zone.
Looking at the 4-hour chart, things seem much clearer. The price has recently tested the midline of the channel but has been rejected decisively. Yet today’s action gives us the most significant clue, as the price has been dropping aggressively.
The RSI also shows values below 50%, as momentum is in favor of the sellers. Therefore, things can get ugly if the $60K level breaks to the downside.
