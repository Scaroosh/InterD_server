Article Title: BTC, ETH and XRP Price Prediction for May 13

Article Text:
Buyers are trying to seize the initiative at the beginning of the week, according to CoinStats.
The price of Bitcoin (BTC) has risen by 2.68% over the last day.
On the daily time frame, the rate of BTC is about to close in the bullish zone. However, it is too early to think about a reversal, as buyers have not accumulated enough energy yet. In this case, sideways trading in the narrow range of $62,000-$64,000 is the more likely scenario for the next few days.
Bitcoin is trading at $62,845 at press time.
Ethereum (ETH) has followed the rise of BTC, going up by 0.87%.
On the daily chart, the price of the main altcoin has not bounced far from the support level, which means that there is still a chance to see a decline. Buyers might start thinking about a possible reversal only if the breakout of the vital zone of $3,000 happens.
Ethereum is trading at $2,951 at press time.
XRP is not an exceptional to the rule, rising by 0.64%.
From the technical point of view, XRP has chances for ongoing growth. Such a scenario may happen if the daily candle closes near or above the $0.51 zone. In that case, an upward move may lead to the test of $0.52 soon.
XRP is trading at $0.5074 at press time.
