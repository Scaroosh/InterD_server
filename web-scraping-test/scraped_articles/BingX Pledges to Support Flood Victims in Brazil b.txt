In Japan, crypto donations have become an increasingly popular means of providing aid. Multiple firms have rallied to support victims of the Noto Peninsula earthquake, which claimed over 60 lives on January 1. Tens of millions of yen in donations have already been collected by HashPalette, a subsidiary of HashPort Group, in collaboration with other Japanese crypto companies.
This is not the first time we have seen crypto donations for disasters. Earlier this year, HashPalette’s Web3PrayForJapan campaign, which promoted donations across multiple blockchain networks such as Cardano, Polygon, and IOST for earthquake victims. Key players in the Japanese crypto industry, including Nemtus, Astar Foundation, Startale Labs, and Oasys, were coordinating efforts, setting up dedicated wallets to ensure that cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, and OAS reach affected communities.

More charities are embracing Bitcoin, Ethereum, and various altcoins as viable and efficient means of raising funds, proving that the decentralized nature of blockchain can revolutionize disaster aid.
These unified efforts by BingX, HashPalette, and other organizations showcase how the cryptocurrency community is harnessing technology to offer hope and financial support during some of humanity’s most challenging moments.
