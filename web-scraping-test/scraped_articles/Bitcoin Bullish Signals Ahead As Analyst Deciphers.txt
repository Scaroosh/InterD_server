Daan Crypto Trades, a full-time crypto trader and investor, offers a pragmatic perspective on Bitcoin’s recent price fluctuations. Despite market euphoria and apprehension, Daan Crypto emphasizes the importance of patience in navigating the volatile landscape. Bitcoin’s current price of $62,371.65, along with a 24-hour trading volume of $25.19 billion, depicts a market mood marked by unpredictable highs and lows.

Moreover, while the average participant anticipates linear movements, historical data suggests otherwise. Bitcoin’s price trajectory is marked by oscillations, with a 15% bounce from lows followed by a 5% downturn. Daan underscores the necessity of patience amidst this volatility, urging investors to acknowledge the gradual formation of higher lows or reversals.
Amidst the current market dynamics, Bitcoin exhibits resilience beyond typical cycle patterns. Despite a 1.85% decline in the last 24 hours, Bitcoin’s Relative Strength Index (RSI) of 43.63 hints at a potential short-term price increase. Additionally, a bullish trend indicated by the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) at 46 underscores the possibility of continued price appreciation.

Subsequently, external factors such as the political landscape also influence Bitcoin’s trajectory. Speculation surrounding a potential second Trump administration presents both opportunities and challenges for the cryptocurrency market. Analysts posit that Trump’s reelection could foster a supportive regulatory environment, positively impacting Bitcoin’s hedge against de-dollarization and declining confidence in the U.S. Treasury market.

Moreover, a Trump victory may accelerate the withdrawal of foreign buyers from the U.S. Treasury market due to fiscal concerns. This could lead to a steeper nominal 2-year/10-year curve and an increase in term premium, consequently bolstering Bitcoin’s price. Notably, under Trump’s first term, average annual net selling of U.S. government debt amounted to $207 billion, compared to $55 billion under Biden’s presidency.
