The third-biggest bank in the US, Wells Fargo, has just revealed how heavily it is involved in the cryptocurrency market, namely through Bitcoin Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs), which was echoed by popular crypto trader Ash Crypto.
A current filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) indicates that the bank is long in the Futures and Spot Bitcoin ETFs from Grayscale. The bank has also invested in Bitcoin Depot Inc., the industry leader in Bitcoin ATMs.

With this action, Wells Fargo shows that it is firmly committed to including digital assets in its financial services. The bankâ€™s latest investments demonstrate the growing institutional interest in Bitcoin, which is in line with a larger tendency toward cryptocurrency acceptance by conventional financial institutions.
Twenty-four has been a critical year for Bitcoin ETFs, signaling their significant ascent in the financial industry. First approved in January, these funds let investors participate in the price swings of Bitcoin without really owning the currency. Ever since, their appeal has only increased, attracting a great deal of interest from institutional and retail investors.
The industry mostly supported Spot Bitcoin ETF approval because of its possible influence on Bitcoin adoption. The participation of Wells Fargo is a prime example of this tendency, as the bank and other organizations look to use these resources to introduce their customers to bitcoin investing.
But the value of Bitcoin has not traveled smoothly. As per the latest CoinMarketCap data, the price of BTC has fallen recently; it is now about $60,845.72, down 3.30% in the previous 24 hours and 2.80% in the last week. Despite this recent decline, Bitcoin hit an all-time high of $73,000 earlier this year, which was partially a result of the rise in ETF investments.
Significantly raising their positions in the bitcoin market are other big firms like Susquehanna International Group. According to a prior report by Crypto News Flash, the firm invested over $1 billion in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC) and other Bitcoin ETF equities in the first quarter of 2024 alone.
