According to Michael Van De Poppe, CEO of MN Trading Consultancy, Bitcoin appears to be moving steadily towards testing the lower boundary of its current trading range. Despite the market lull that followed Bitcoin’s recent halving event, he remains optimistic about the cryptocurrency’s potential, citing that it seems likely we’ll continue the upwards grind. He also acknowledged the current market’s tedium, noting,
“Boredom has started since the Bitcoin halving took place.”

Benjamin Cowen, a prominent crypto analyst, urged investors to remain cautious about the risks surrounding Ethereum and other altcoins. He pointed out that during the previous two breakdowns of the ETH/BTC trading pair, Ethereum’s USD value plummeted by around 70%.
“In a world where everyone has been preaching Alt Season for the last 2.5 years into a #BTC dominance uptrend,” he said, “I thought I would remind people that there is still downside risk.”

Overall, market sentiment suggests that Bitcoin is currently navigating a key technical phase, with hopes for renewed upward momentum. Based on stats from IntoTheBlock, Bitcoin (BTC) was priced at $62,158 as of press time, experiencing a 24-hour decrease of 1.86%. Despite this decline, the substantial market cap of $1.25 trillion suggests a strong investor base and a significant valuation within the cryptocurrency market.
The holder composition provides more detailed insights into market sentiment and behavior. Notably, 88% of Bitcoin holders are profiting at the current price, whereas a small percentage (5%) are breaking even, and 6% are at a loss. This indicates that most investors are currently in a favorable position despite the day’s negative price movement.
In terms of transaction volumes, there have been $82.02 billion in transactions over $100K in the past 7 days, demonstrating high activity levels among large-scale investors. Additionally, the geographical distribution of transactions is evenly split between the Western and Eastern hemispheres, suggesting a balanced global interest and trading activity in Bitcoin.
Regarding market dynamics, only 11% of Bitcoin’s supply is held by large holders, which suggests a relatively decentralized holding pattern compared to some other cryptocurrencies where wealth is more concentrated. This could imply a lesser risk of market manipulation by a small number of holders.
