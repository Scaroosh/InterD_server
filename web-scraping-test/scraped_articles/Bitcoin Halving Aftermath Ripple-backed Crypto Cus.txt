Amidst the aftermath of the Bitcoin halving and a shifting landscape in the mining industry, insights from Manthan Dave, Co-Founder of Palisade, Ripple-backed digital asset custody platform, shed light on the evolving dynamics.   —  As the mining sector grapples with profitability challenges and potential consolidation, Dave offers perspectives on the future trajectory of the miner ecosystem.   Dave delves into the implications of jurisdictional arbitrage, regulatory clarity, and the role of Spot Bitcoin ETFs in stabilizing the market post-halving. Additionally, Dave forecasts the potential impact of Ethereum ETFs and envisions Bitcoin's price trajectory, suggesting a bullish outlook.  Navigating the Post-Halving Squeeze  Dave reflects, “Everyone is feeling the squeeze post halving. We will see smaller, less efficient mining setups struggle or collapse.  "Consolidation will continue, sparking fears about centralisation. It’s not going to stop unless there’s a real technological change, i.e. significantly power-efficient miners or a more efficient way to generate energy that gives the power back to the masses."  Manthan Dave, Co-Founder of Palisade And day by day, I am less hopeful of that because, with the amount of power and money these mining companies have, they are better equipped to control the R&D narrative.  Jurisdictional arbitrage is a strong lever to pull for new entrants, considering it is already quite difficult and capital intensive to get started. Regulatory clarity in a jurisdiction where electricity costs are low can open up opportunities for new companies to launch mining operations. Government policy on taxation, ease of doing business will certainly play a critical part in this.  Miners that are exiting the bitcoin ecosystem due to cost reasons are unlikely to exit crypto itself. They are likely to reuse their hardware and switch to mining on other chains or redeploy capital into other operations such as staking.”  Spot Bitcoin ETFs: A Game-Changer  Regarding the impact of Spot Bitcoin ETFs, Dave remarks, “Spot bitcoin ETFs are a game-changer. They make it easy for institutions and investors to hold bitcoin for the long term without the need for managing private keys.  "This consistent buy pressure will counteract the sell pressure from miners, leading to a more stable and bullish Bitcoin market."  Manthan Dave, Co-Founder of Palisade In the long term, they will raise confidence in crypto and reduce the overall market’s volatility. What happens when the Ethereum ETF launches remains to be seen. It will certainly bring new capital as ethereum is more “green” than bitcoin. But it is also likely to draw capital out of the bitcoin ETF as investors will seek to diversify.  Looking at what's on the horizon, it is likely that we will see bitcoin teasing $100,000 by the end of this year," concludes Dave.  —  About Palisade  Palisade, renowned for its comprehensive digital asset management solutions, provides businesses with a secure foundation to navigate the complexities of custody.
