Article Title: Bitcoin Lending Startup Secures $3.5M in Funding Round Led by Tim Draper Report

Article Text:
Bitcoin lending startup Zest Protocol has secured $3.5 million in a funding round led by venture capitalist Tim Draper, Reuters reported. The investment, joined by notable backers including Binance Labs and Flow Traders, signals growing confidence in the crypto lending industry despite regulatory scrutiny.
Unlike traditional lending platforms, the six-employee startup operates a decentralized model, enabling peer-to-peer transactions without intermediaries. Zest Protocol aims to disrupt the Bitcoin lending landscape by offering users the ability to lend out their Bitcoin or borrow against it, providing an alternative to selling and allowing them to earn passive income.
Zest's Founder Tycho Onnasch emphasized the platform's divergence from the regulatory targets amid regulatory challenges from the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The company plans to expand its platform with the new funding, aiming for a broader rollout later this year. Onnasch underscored the company's conservative approach to yield generation, signaling a departure from the high-yield offerings prevalent in the early days of crypto.
Others investors who participated in the funding round include Binance Labs and Flow Traders. Draper, known for his early investments in transformative tech ventures like SpaceX, Tesla, and Coinbase, is optimistic about the adoption of Bitcoin. His support highlights the emergence of bitcoin as an institutional asset and the growing ecosystem surrounding it.
