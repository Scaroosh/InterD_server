Article Title: Bitcoin Long-Term Holders Accumulating Like In 2021 Is BTC Ready For A 15X

Article Text:
Bitcoin is moving sideways, posting drab price action, forcing participation to taper. But amid this consolidation and even fear of more losses, one analyst has shared data suggesting that long-term holders are accumulating at spot rates.
In a post on X, the analyst noted that this re-accumulating pace is picking up momentum, mirroring a welcomed trend that preceded the impressive 2021 bull run.
Therefore, if long-term holders, or HODLers, accumulate, the probability of BTC rallying in the sessions ahead is elevated. Thus far, BTC has been trending above $60,000, up 10% from the May 2024 lows.

For clarity, the data shared by the analyst uses Unspent Transaction Outputs (UTXOs) to classify long-term and short-term holders. Analyzing the age of UTXOs makes it easier to gauge the behavior of different investor groups.
Despite the potential for short-term volatility, the analyst encourages investors to maintain a long-term perspective. Accumulating Bitcoin at these levels and exercising patience could be a winning strategy, the analyst says.
Before then, traders should watch price action. The coin is moving sideways, finding rejection at $66,000. Even though prices are lower, the last dayâ€™s series of higher highs is encouraging and might spark demand.
