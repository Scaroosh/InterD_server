Article Title: Bitcoin Stalls at $61K While European Equities Rally, BoE Hints at Summer Rate Cut

Article Text:
Despite a rally in European equity indices, Bitcoin is struggling to maintain its position above the $61,000 mark. This challenge coincides with the Bank of Englandâ€™s decision to keep interest rates steady while hinting at a potential rate cut during the summer. According to the report, the European markets, both the FTSE 100 and the Stoxx 600 index saw gains, with the FTSE 100 hitting a new all-time high.
On Thursday, the BoE expressed confidence that the UK economy had recovered in the first quarter, ending a brief recession.
ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡§ The Bank of England comes out today with what the market has interpreted as a "dovish hold".They are looking a lot more likely to cut next month.And will probably join the ðŸ‡ªðŸ‡º ECB in a June cut.The global cutting cycle has begun. https://t.co/f9G5QF2Aix pic.twitter.com/6m1ETKuDkF
Interestingly, the timing of the Bank of Englandâ€™s potential rate cut at 5.25% for the sixth consecutive time has become politically significant ahead of the upcoming general election. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak aims to reassure voters about the UKâ€™s economic stability amidst a cost of living crisis.
European central banks are also considering reducing interest rates, anticipating lower inflation compared to the US. BoE Governor Bailey clarified that the Fedâ€™s actions wonâ€™t necessarily dictate their decisions. However, the BoE is cautious about acting too quickly after successfully lowering inflation from double digits to 3.2%.
Although some analysts anticipate a rate cut, they caution that the current macroeconomic environment of higher-for-longer interest rates may persist for years to come, influenced by factors such as post-2008 financial crisis trends. Despite these developments, Bitcoin experienced a slight decline of over 1% in the last 24 hours, trading at $61,411.
The pound lost value against both the dollar and the euro after Thursdayâ€™s decision. This was good for exporters and international companies on Londonâ€™s FTSE 100 index, which hit a new high. At the same time, Frankfurtâ€™s market reached a new high point, thanks to hopes that the ECB and the Fed would soon lower interest rates. Even though the market was positive, a well-known international group recently predicted that the UK would only grow by 0.4% this year because of high interest rates and ongoing inflation.
