In a separate development, a major Bitcoin investor from 2013 recently moved over 1,000 BTC. It reaped a remarkable profit of 49,274.2%. This significant transaction highlights the substantial gains made by early adopters of the pioneering cryptocurrency.
Just last week, data from Santiment revealed that large whales, holding between 1,000 and 10,000 BTC, collectively accumulated approximately $941 million worth of coins. This surge in accumulation coincided with its tight range between $61,000 and $64,000, signaling a renewed bullish sentiment among institutional investors.
As of the latest market update, Bitcoin is trading at $62,501, reflecting a 2.73% surge. With a trading volume of $27 billion, marking a 65% increase. Despite the recent gains, Bitcoin remains 15.31% away from its all-time high, indicating the potential for further upward movement.
Analysts say that these accumulation trends among whales and positive market indicators suggest confidence in Bitcoin’s resilience amidst market volatility.
