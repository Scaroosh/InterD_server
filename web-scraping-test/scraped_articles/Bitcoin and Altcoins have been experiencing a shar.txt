Volatile movements have been observed in the cryptocurrency industry recently. At this point, Bitcoin, which rose above $65,000 at the beginning of the week, fell to $60,000 during the week.
BTC, which rose above $ 63,000 again today, has started to decline again in recent hours.
In the last hour, Bitcoin fell again to $ 60,000, while altcoins were also negatively affected.
While Ethereum (ETH) fell below $ 3,000 to $ 2,930, many altcoins experienced similar declines.

While there is currently no negative news in the market that could trigger the decline in Bitcoin and altcoins, the reason for the decline is not fully known.
However, analysts predict that this decline may be a leverage clearing.
According to Coinglass's data, 62 million dollars in long positions were liquidated in the last hour. While a total of 149 million dollars were liquidated in the last 24 hours, the majority of them consisted of long positions.
