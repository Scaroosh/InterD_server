Article Title: Bitcoin's April plunge leads to $2.92 billion in spot outflows

Article Text:
Bitcoin faced massive selling pressure in April 2024, recording its most significant monthly decline of 15% since November 2022, when it dropped over 16%. CryptoSlate previously analyzed the factors contributing to the dip, finding that the conclusion of the US tax season, compounded by various economic factors, prompted the sell-off. However, Bitcoin rebounded most of its losses in April and May.
Bitcoin appeared to have hit a local bottom on May 1, hitting a low of roughly $56,800. It has since climbed over 11%.

According to data from Coinglass, Bitcoin saw substantial net outflows during April and early May, exceeding $500 million on two occasions: on April 13 ($547 million) amidst tensions in the Middle East and on May 1 ($536 million). The May 1 outflows coincided with the largest recorded outflow from the Bitcoin ETFs since its launch. Between April 9 and May 1, nearly every day saw net outflows, with only two exceptions.

Coinglass data shows that over the past 30 days, Bitcoin saw $2.92 billion in net outflows.

In terms of price performance since the April 20 halving, BTC was trading at approximately $64,000, slightly ahead of the current price. This represents the second-weakest post-halving performance, just ahead of the first epoch. However, historical data suggests that most Bitcoin price gains come after the halving. Therefore, it would be premature to assess BTCâ€™s performance in the current cycle at this stage.
