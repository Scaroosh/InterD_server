Article Title: Bitcoin’s Future Looks Bright PlanB Predicts Massive Gains in Next Halving Cycles

Bitcoin’s journey through the financial landscape is a subject of intense scrutiny and discussion. A recent revelation by PlanB, the analyst known for the Stock to Flow (S2F) model, offers fresh insights into Bitcoin’s valuation and its potential future trajectory. As the crypto community looks towards future halving cycles, PlanB’s updated predictions provide fodder for both supporters and skeptics of Bitcoin’s long-term value.
The Stock to Flow model, widely regarded in the cryptocurrency sphere, attempts to predict the price of Bitcoin based on its scarcity, driven by the halving events that reduce the mining reward by half, theoretically increasing scarcity. PlanB’s initial model had projected an average price of $55,000 for Bitcoin in the 2020-2024 halving cycle.
Although the actual average price noted has been around $34,000—a figure slightly lower than expected—it still impresses considering the sub-$4,000 levels seen when the predictions were made.
Average bitcoin price 2020-2024 halving cycle was $34k. A bit below 2019 S2F prediction of $55k, but still in normal range and not bad given BTC<$4k when prediction was made.

Despite not fully meeting the lofty expectations of the S2F model, Bitcoin has demonstrated resilience and a gradual recovery in recent weeks. The cryptocurrency has registered a 4.1% increase over the past week, with continued positive adjustments in the 24-hour frame, hinting at a possible resurgence. This recent uplift aligns with broader market sentiments and reflects investors’ renewed confidence following turbulent periods.
PlanB has not only reflected on past predictions but also looked forward, adjusting the S2F model with new data. The refined model forecasts a striking rise to $500,000 in the 2024-2028 cycle and an even more astonishing increase to $4 million in the 2028-2032 cycle. These figures are based on the continuing premise that Bitcoin’s decreasing supply, due to subsequent halvings, will play a pivotal role in its price escalation.
While the S2F model and its predictions remain speculative and based on the theoretical supply constraints, they spark significant discussion among investors about the role of scarcity in asset valuation. Critics argue that factors beyond mere supply—such as technological advancements, regulatory changes, and broader economic shifts—have substantial impacts on Bitcoin’s price that the S2F model may not fully account for.
Moreover, the implications of these predictions are vast, suggesting a transformative potential for Bitcoin in the global financial landscape. If Bitcoin were to approach the figures predicted, it would not only affirm its ‘digital gold’ moniker but also reshape investment, monetary policy, and even global economic power balances.
