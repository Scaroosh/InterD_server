Article Title: Bitfarms Shares Plunged After CEO Firing

Article Text:
Bitfarms announced the termination of Geoffrey Morphy as its interim President and CEO.
This decision came shortly after Morphy filed a lawsuit against the company, seeking $27 million in damages for claims including breach of contract and wrongful dismissal.
The company has dismissed Morphy’s claims as baseless and has vowed to defend itself vigorously in the Superior Court of Ontario.
Morphy’s termination marks a tumultuous period for Bitfarms, which is currently navigating various challenges in the crypto-mining sector. The industry suffers from rising energy costs and intense competition, compounded by the recent Bitcoin halving that has significantly cut revenue from mining operations.
As Bitfarms continues its search for a CEO, Nicolas Bonta, co-founder and chairman, has stepped in as the interim leader. The company expressed confidence that the executive search is nearing completion, with an appointment expected in the coming weeks.
“The CEO executive search is nearing completion and that the Company will be appointing a new CEO in the next several weeks,” the company wrote.

The market reacted negatively to Morphy’s firing, with Bitfarms’ shares falling over 6% on the announcement day. Such price action reflects concerns over the company’s stability and future direction.
Last year, Bitfarms CEO Emiliano Grodzki resigned and was replaced by Geoffrey Morphy, who was fired this year. This comes amid a disastrous year for Bitcoin miners, which caused some large companies to declare bankruptcy.
