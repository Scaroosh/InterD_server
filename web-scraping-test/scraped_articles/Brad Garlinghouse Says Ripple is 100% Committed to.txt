During the chat, Garlinghouse emphatically stated that anyone doubting Ripple’s commitment to XRP is mistaken.
It bears mentioning that several factors have emerged over the past few months that have stirred doubts among investors regarding Ripple’s commitment to XRP.
One of these factors is the company’s plan to launch a stablecoin later this year. Several market watchers speculated that the stablecoin, which will debut on the XRP Ledger and Ethereum, will allow U.S.-based clients to initiate cross-border settlements via the On-Demand Liquidity solution (now Ripple Payments).
Although Ripple has not publicly confirmed this speculation, analysts noted that the stablecoin will enable the company to navigate the regulatory landscape in the United States, where it is currently embroiled in a lawsuit against the SEC.
Nonetheless, critics believe that Ripple plans to choose the stablecoin over XRP as the preferred asset for international payments.
Another factor that stirred doubts about the company’s dedication to XRP was the asset’s exclusion from Ripple’s Liquidity Hub. The hub provides liquidity for businesses to buy, sell, and hold digital assets.
Before its launch, Ripple said the platform would support XRP and other top crypto assets, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. However, the company excluded XRP from the list of supported assets, citing regulatory concerns in the United States.
With several critics speculating that Ripple is pivoting away from XRP, Garlinghouse’s comment is a testament that this is untrue. Ripple’s upcoming stablecoin and XRP’s exclusion from the Liquidity Hub product is part of the company’s efforts to navigate the United States regulatory landscape.
