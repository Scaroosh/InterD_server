Article Title: Casa Co-Founder Jameson Lopp Attacks on Cryptocurrency Whales Are Vastly Underreported

Article Text:
Jameson Lopp, the co-founder of Casa, a Bitcoin services company, referred to increasing attacks targeting cryptocurrency whales. On social media, Lopp stated that “while still relatively rare,” the number of targeted attacks against crypto whales was “vastly underreported.” Lopp explained that many victims of these thefts and hacks hesitated to consult law enforcement out of fear of drawing attention to the origins of their holdings. Brian Lockhart, Director of Technical Program Management at Bitocin miner Core Scientific, supported Lopp’s statements, stressing that victims did not want “the embarrassment, possible IRS attention, and further attacks” linked to disclosing having been the victim of a crypto hack.
