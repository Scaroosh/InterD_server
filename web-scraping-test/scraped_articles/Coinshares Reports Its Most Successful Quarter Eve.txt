The CEO, Jean-Marie Mognetti, highlighted the acquisition of Valkyrie’s ETF business (exchange-traded funds) as a pivotal move that expanded their operations across the Atlantic. The company’s Asset Management division saw strong inflows, particularly from Coinshares Physical, contributing significantly to the platform’s performance. The Capital Markets & Hedge Fund Solutions division delivered robust top-line performance, thriving particularly after the launch of the US Spot Bitcoin ETFs. The Board of Directors approved a new dividend policy for the fiscal year 2023, committing to an annual dividend of 20% to 40% of the group’s total comprehensive income.
