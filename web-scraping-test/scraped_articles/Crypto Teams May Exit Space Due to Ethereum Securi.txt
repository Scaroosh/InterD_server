Article Title: Crypto Teams May Exit Space Due to Ethereum Security Classification, Amina Bank Report Suggests

Article Text:
The classification of ethereum as a security poses not only risks to the entire crypto market, but it could also likely lead to many crypto teams exiting the space. This designation might hinder progress and potentially reverse years of advancements in the cryptocurrency market. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission has likely delayed its decision on ethereum’s status to keep the crypto asset in a “grey area.”
According to Amina Bank, designating ethereum (ETH) as a security “would pose significant risks to the entire cryptocurrency and decentralized finance (defi) ecosystem.” Such a designation could result in defi platforms that allow users to leverage the cryptocurrency asset being deemed “unregistered securities brokers.” Furthermore, cryptocurrency exchanges intending to list ETH would be required to register with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).
However, in its latest Crypto Market Monitor report, the Swiss-based banking group said the operational complexities resulting from such a designation would force “most teams in crypto to exit the space.” The report also warned that if the SEC were to proceed to declare ETH a security, protocols using the proof-of-stake (PoS) consensus may be forced to return to a proof-of-work (PoW) consensus.
“Gensler has suggested that such PoS chains, rewarding users for locking up their coins, resemble investment contracts and could be deemed securities, without specifically mentioning ETH. Given that most major blockchains, apart from PoW Bitcoin, work on PoS like Ethereum, regulators might extend similar classifications to them,” the report stated.
The report further noted that non-ETH tokens, which are hosted on the Ethereum blockchain, could face repercussions due to their close association with a potential security. The Amina Bank report also suggested that if the SEC classifies ETH as a security, it could not only hinder progress but also potentially undo years of advancements in the cryptocurrency market.
In the same report, the team from Amina Bank presented several factors that undermine the argument for classifying ETH as a security. The report also suggested that if the Howey Test were applied today, ethereum (ETH) would not meet the criteria to be considered a security.
Moreover, the report notes that another U.S. regulator, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), already recognizes ETH as a commodity and has even permitted futures trading of ethereum. The report states that the SEC’s approval of ethereum futures exchange-traded funds (ETFs) for trading on regulated security exchanges further emphasizes the crypto asset’s status as a non-security.
In conclusion, the report suggests that the SEC is cognizant of the disadvantages of declaring ethereum a security but has delayed its decision to keep ethereum in a “grey area.” This, in turn, allows the SEC to postpone its decision on the applications for U.S. spot Ethereum ETFs.
