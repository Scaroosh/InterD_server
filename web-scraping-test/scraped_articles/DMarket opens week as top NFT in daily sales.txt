The collection had a total of 36,900 transactions, involving 4,304 unique buyers and 3,555 sellers.
DMarket is a Mythos-based collection that represents in-game items for popular games like Counter-Strike 2 and Dota 2, both of which feature in top esports competitions. The International 2021, a Dota 2 tournament held in Bucharest, Romania, had a prize pool of US$40 million, the largest in esports history.
DMarket’s market-leading daily sales on Monday pushed its historic sales volume to US$422 million, now the 16th all time.

Last Thursday, NodeMonkes led the NFT market to flip SATS (a BRC-20 bundle) to claim the all-time leading spot among Bitcoin-based collections.
