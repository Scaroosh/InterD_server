Article Title: DOGE Price Prediction Will DOGE Crash Again to $0.10

Article Text:
The cryptocurrency market has been experiencing considerable volatility, with DOGE, in particular, attracting significant attention. Over the past 24 hours, the market saw a marginal decline of 0.51%, while DOGE's weekly performance paints a more alarming picture, showing a substantial loss of 11.45%. As investors grapple with these fluctuations, the question on everyone's mind is whether DOGE will experience another crash, potentially plummeting to $0.10.
Analyzing DOGE's performance reveals a tumultuous journey over the past week. Despite its slight decline in the last 24 hours, DOGE remains an active player in the market, with a traded volume of $592 million. However, its significant weekly loss underscores the challenges it faces amidst the current market dynamics. This is clear as we can clearly see a downtrend that started as soon as DOGE prices hit the year-high price of $0.22.

DOGE's recent downturn can be attributed to broader market trends, with many cryptocurrencies, including DOGE, succumbing to selling pressure. Bitcoin's failure to breach its all-time high has cast a shadow over the entire market, triggering a corrective phase. Consequently, DOGE has retreated from its recent highs, settling at its current price of $0.1430.
As DOGE hovers around the $0.140 mark, investors are closely monitoring its next move. This critical level has been tested in recent weeks, reflecting the intense tug-of-war between buyers and sellers. Should DOGE breach this level, it may pave the way for a further decline towards targets of $0.13 and $0.12.
However, upwards trends can propel DOGE prices higher towards the following targets:- $0.16- $0.18- $0.20
