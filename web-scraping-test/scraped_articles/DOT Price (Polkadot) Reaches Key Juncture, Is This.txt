Article Title: DOT Price (Polkadot) Reaches Key Juncture, Is This Bulls Trap or Correction

Article Text:
Polkadot (DOT) is correcting gains from the $7.5 resistance against the US Dollar. The price could start another increase if it stays above the $6.75 support.
After forming a base above the $6.00 level, DOT price started a decent increase. It broke many hurdles near $6.75 and even spiked above $7.25. A high was formed at $7.46 and the price is now correcting gains, like Ethereum and Bitcoin.
There was a move below the $7.25 support zone. The price declined below the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $6.03 swing low to the $7.46 high.
DOT is now trading above the $7.00 zone and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $7.25 level. The next major resistance is near $7.50. There is also a short-term expanding triangle forming with resistance at $7.50 on the 4-hour chart of the DOT/USD pair.

A successful break above $7.50 could start another strong rally. In the stated case, the price could easily rally toward $8.00 in the near term. The next major resistance is seen near the $8.80 zone.
If DOT price fails to start a fresh increase above $7.25, it could continue to move down. The first key support is near the $7.00 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
The next major support is near the $6.75 level or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $6.03 swing low to the $7.46 high, below which the price might decline to $6.50. Any more losses may perhaps open the doors for a move toward the $6.10 support zone or $6.00.
