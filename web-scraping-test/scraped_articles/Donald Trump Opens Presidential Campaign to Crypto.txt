The attendees had purchased over 47 NFTs individually, each priced at $99. In his speech, Trump noted, “We did it when NFTs were not hot. We made NFTs hot again.”
Trump reassured attendees that if there were any hurdles in donating via crypto, he would address them, ensuring an accessible avenue for supporters to contribute to his campaign.
“If you can’t, I’ll make sure you can. Can we donate to the Trump campaign using crypto? I believe the answer is yes,” Trump said.
Historically, Trump has been skeptical about cryptocurrencies, as evident from his 2019 tweet denouncing Bitcoin and its counterparts as not being real money. However, his recent statements represent a pivot, positioning him as a pro-cryptocurrency candidate in the upcoming election.
During the event, Trump emphasized the importance of crypto supporters voting for him, framing himself as the tech-savvy alternative to Biden.
"If you’re in favor of crypto, you better vote for Trump," he declared, signaling a direct appeal to digital currency advocates.
Further, the former US President reaffirmed his commitment to helping crypto businesses remain in the United States. Specifically, he promised to prevent crypto companies from leaving if they were looking to relocate due to hostility.
Trump leveraged this moment to further criticize the Biden administration's approach to digital assets, claiming a stark contrast in their understanding and support of the burgeoning crypto economy.
Trump-related memecoins coins like $TRUMP and $TREMP rose by 35% and 120% in the last 24 hours after clips of the event went viral on X.
