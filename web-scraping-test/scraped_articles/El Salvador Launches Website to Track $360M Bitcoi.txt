The platform is hosted at bitcoin.gob.sv, provides real-time data on the nation's bitcoin reserves.
Using public information from Bukele's tweets and blockchain data, the site details how the country has accumulated over 5,748 BTC worth roughly $360 million.
This stash has been built up since 2021 through daily purchases of 1 BTC, larger bulk buys, and mining via geothermal energy.
Earlier, Bukele had released a Bitcoin address for people to monitor the nation's holdings. Now, the new website validates this information and offers public proof of reserves.
Launching this platform represents a major step towards financial transparency in government operations.By leveraging Bitcoin's innate audibility, El Salvador continues leading the way.
Despite short-term fluctuations, the country already sits on $57 million in unrealized profit due to effective dollar cost averaging.
El Salvador's Bitcoin treasury tracker promotes openness and confidence in its pioneering Bitcoin strategy.
This economic experiment and embrace of Bitcoin set an example for other nations to follow. The website should also help attract further Bitcoin investment and innovation in El Salvador.
