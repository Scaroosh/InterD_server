Ethereum price is extended losses and tested the $2,940 support. ETH could start a fresh increase if it clears the $3,000 and $3,030 resistance levels.

Immediate resistance is near the $3,000 level or the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,218 swing high to the $2,936 low. The first major resistance is near the $3,030 level or the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average.

The next key resistance sits at $3,080 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the recent decline from the $3,218 swing high to the $2,936 low, above which the price might gain traction and rise toward the $3,150 level. If there is a clear move above the $3,150 level, the price might rise and test the $3,220 resistance. Any more gains could send Ether toward the $3,350 resistance zone.
If Ethereum fails to clear the $3,030 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $2,965 level. The first major support is near the $2,940 zone.
The next support is near the $2,880 level. A clear move below the $2,880 support might push the price toward $2,720. Any more losses might send the price toward the $2,650 level in the near term.
