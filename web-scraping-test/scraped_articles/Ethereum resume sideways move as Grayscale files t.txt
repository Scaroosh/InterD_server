Article Title: Ethereum resume sideways move as Grayscale files to withdraw Ethereum futures ETF application with the SEC

Article Text:
Ethereum is hinting at a resumption of a sideways movement on Tuesday after seeing inflows for the first time in seven weeks. Grayscale withdrew its application for an Ethereum futures ETF, and the Securities & Exchange Commission’s (SEC) Chair Gary Gensler has also called most crypto assets securities following a Wells Notice targeted at ETH-related firms.
Ethereum's price uncertainty among investors is increasing despite recent updates surrounding the largest altcoin. Here are the top market movers:
Ethereum is looking to resume a sideways movement again on Tuesday after failing to stay above the $3,161 resistance.

ETH/USDT 4-hour chart
ETH's current price action suggests the popular altcoin would likely follow a horizontal pattern — but more tilted towards shorts — amid uncertainty among traders.  This is confirmed by ETH's liquidations data, which — having slowed down — still sees long liquidations forming the bulk of the digital asset's total liquidations. ETH long liquidations are at $34.56 million, while shorts are at only $8.25 million, according to data from Coinglass.
Coinglass data also shows that Ethereum's open interest has remained relatively flat for the past four days, further strengthening the sideways thesis. If ETH goes below the $3,029 support, it may begin a brief bearish trend.  However, the $2,852 to $3,300 key range is also proving strong as ETH may not see any sustained move outside in the next few weeks, except if the price of Bitcoin sees a significant spike.
Ethereum is trading around $3,067, down 0.3% on the day.
