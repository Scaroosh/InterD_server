Article Title: Experts Project XRP Potential Surge to $3 and $20

Article Text:
Two renowned crypto investors have issued positive predictions regarding XRP‚Äôs potential spike to $3 and $20, respectively.
XRP has continued to feel the impact of the ongoing market onslaught, as its price crashes below $0.50 on multiple occasions in 24 hours.
Despite rebounding above the $0.50 price level, XRP has witnessed a 2.5% decline over the past 24 hours and a 4.72% dip in the weekly charts. At the current exchange rate of $0.5057, XRP‚Äôs price has dipped by 18.1% year-to-date (YTD).
Nevertheless, prominent crypto enthusiasts still believe XRP could embark on a major rally in this 2024/2025 bull season. They expect XRP‚Äôs price to range between $3 and $20 this season.
In particular, early Bitcoin investor Kyle Chass√© speculated that XRP would attain a peak price of $3 in the bull run. The investor made this known while predicting the peak prices of popular crypto assets.
With XRP currently trading at $0.5057, the asset would need to rally by 493.23% to reach the $3 target. It bears mentioning that the $3 prediction is below the all-time high of $3.84 XRP recorded in January 2018.
Meanwhile, Chass√© did not didn‚Äôt provide any concrete basis for his bullish XRP prediction.

Additionally, a popular crypto analyst who uses the X handle @KingCryptoAryan issued an audacious prediction for XRP, speculating that the asset‚Äôs price could soar to $20 this bull season.
Aryan‚Äôs $20 prediction requires XRP to soar 3,854% from its current price. Like Chass√©, Aryan did not outline any bullish factor he relied on before issuing the prediction.

It is worth mentioning that prominent investors and analysts have filed the XRP community with forecasts regarding the asset‚Äôs potential spike to $3 and $20, respectively.
Last month, popular crypto investor Ash projected that XRP could surge to $3 between April 2025 and July 2025. This period is expected to be the peak of the coming bull season. Additionally, other proponents like EGRAG predicted that XRP could revisit its all-time high around the $3 price level this season.
Besides Aryan, other notable crypto experts have also issued a similar forecast regarding XRP‚Äôs potential rally to $20. As reported earlier, Armando Pantoja, a member of the Bezinga crypto advisory council, issued a similar stance this month.
In his analysis, Pantoja projected that XRP would reach a ‚Äútrue value range‚Äù of $8 ‚Äì $20 by 2026. The factors backing Pantoja‚Äôs prediction include XRP‚Äôs legal clary, historical precedent, institutional adoption, market trends, and utility explosion.
Pantoja issued a similar prediction last month, emphasizing that XRP will soar between $10 and $20. However, he did not provide a timeline he expects the prediction to materialize.
