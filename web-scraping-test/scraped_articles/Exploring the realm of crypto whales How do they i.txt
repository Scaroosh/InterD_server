Market Sentiment is another trap that many investors fall for. When an investor sees a crypto whale investing in a particular crypto, they tend to follow in their footsteps and invest in the same crypto since they have confidence in the crypto whale movements. If the whale starts to sell the suddenly bought cryptos, the investor will be confused and faced with the fear of loss, and they, too, will sell the crypto for a lower rate than they have bought.

Even the crypto experts and analysts will provide information based on the activities undergone by crypto whales. Thus, they implement the pump and dump scheme where the whales suddenly purchase several cryptos just to increase the price of that crypto artificially; then, they will sell it off for a profit, leaving the investors with losses.
Crypto whales invest their money in cryptos that they predict will increase in value over time in the future. They conclude based on the crypto market movements and make sure to buy a huge amount of that particular crypto, keep hold of them, and earn a return on their investment by investing these in crypto-based projects.
Regulatory and ethical considerations have to be done by crypto whales while they indulge in the crypto transaction. They should avoid market manipulation, fraud, and other illegal activities that might hurt other investors. Regulatory agencies like the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) are essential in maintaining a fair marketplace for trading. They should not be involved in schemes like the pump and dump scheme or increasing crypto’s market value.
Though the impact of crypto whales is undeniable, the investor must stay vigilant about the market activities and make clear decisions before investing. Make sure to study the movements of the crypto whales and try to put the pieces together on their intention behind such an investment; wait for a while to see how the market is getting influenced by them, and then consider investing in something.
