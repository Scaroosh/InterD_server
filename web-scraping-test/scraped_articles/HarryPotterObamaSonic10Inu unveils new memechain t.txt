Despite not revealing details, the X post shared that this new blockchain will be a “memechain.” Since the announcement, BITCOIN has risen by 8.5%, 4% over the past 24 hours, and 1,140% since its inception, according to data aggregator CoinGecko. However, the meme coin is nearly 60% below its all-time high at the time of writing.
The token is inspired by a famous meme back in the 2010s, which is the picture of a backpack containing all the words that compose the meme coin’s name.
The movement comes after fellow meme coin Shiba Inu (SHIB) raised $12 million from names such as Mechanism Capital, Animoca Brands, DWF Ventures, and Polygon Ventures, with plans to launch its own layer-3 blockchain. The chairman of Cypher Capital, Bill Qian, stated that Shiba Inu’s blockchain is “set to power up blockchain real-world utility.”
Moreover, Berachain raised $100 million recently to develop its layer-1 blockchain. The blockchain originated from Bong Bears, an NFT project collection that fostered an active community, which then engaged in Berachain’s development.
