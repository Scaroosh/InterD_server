Article Title: Here Are Top Predictions for XRP to Hit $200, $400 and $1000

Article Text:
While XRP trades at $0.5, some prominent figures in the crypto scene have argued the asset could attain lofty highs like $200, $400, and $1,000 someday.
XRP momentarily dipped to the $0.4 mark in the past day before climbing back to the $0.5 level. Despite this recovery, XRP maintains a 5% decline in its weekly trading price. Meanwhile, XRP’s market loss is a more significant 19% over the past month.
On an annual scale, XRP’s growth is a modest 17% gain. This percentage growth contrasts the numbers observable from its peers like Solana (SOL). In particular, SOL has seen a staggering 600% increase over the same timeframe.
Additionally, it’s been six years since XRP established an all-time high and three years since it last traded above $1. Essentially, XRP has not been an impressive performer in the crypto scene in recent times.
However, the lackluster performances have not suppressed the optimism of market pundits who are convinced that XRP has the potential to become a triple—or four-digit asset sometime in the future.
With this in mind, we analyze the top predictions for XRP hitting price points of $200, $400, and $1,000.
Javon Marks is one of the latest market watchers to propose the $200 price point for XRP. In an update earlier this month, Marks highlighted that XRP is nearing the end of a significant symmetrical triangle pattern. Marks described the observed pattern as XRP’s “largest coil pattern.”
Historical data shows a similar formation between 2014 and 2017, after which XRP surged from $0.0056 to $3.84. The analyst pointed out that XRP is currently in a six-year consolidation phase, with increased trading volumes and bullish divergences hinting at a buildup of positive momentum.
Based on this observation, Marks predicted an ambitious breakout to propel XRP by over 37,000% to $200. According to him, this projected explosive move is already gathering momentum.
Notably, Marks has argued that XRP has the potential to attain $200 more than once. Other analysts like Block Bull have voiced similar sentiments, projecting a $246 price point for XRP.
Last year, renowned analyst EGRAG argued a potential 75,300% surge in XRP’s price to $400. Similarly, his bold forecast is grounded on historical patterns and a key indicator called “the Bull Market Line.”
Previously, XRP’s breach of the first Bull Market Line at $0.02 preceded a rally to $3.84 in early 2018. EGRAG identified a second Bull Market Line at $1.2, suggesting that crossing this threshold could trigger rallies to $40 and then $400. However, XRP has not come close to this crucial $1.2 target since 2021.
Citi banker Shannon Thorp once supported this view, although she based her projection of $100 to $500 for XRP on Ripple’s efforts in the cross-border payment market.
Analysts BarriC and JackTheRippler are some of the most ambitious individuals in the XRP community. They argue that XRP has the potential to rally 189,200% to hit $1,000.
BarriC cited historical growth in cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin’s rise from $330 to $73,750, as evidence of the crypto assets’ potential for exponential growth. He argues that with increasing adoption and over $400 trillion in personal wealth potentially entering the market, XRP could hit $1,000 in 10 years.
On the other hand, JackTheRippler contended that with over $1.2 quadrillion in assets available for tokenization, XRP’s blockchain capturing a small fraction of this sum could easily justify a $1,000 XRP price.
