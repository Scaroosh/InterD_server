Article Title: Here are Five Altcoins Under $1 That Could Shine This Bull Season

Article Text:
This article presents a curated list of five promising altcoins under $1, including The Graph (GRT), Sei (SEI), and Harmony (ONE), that could beat expectations this bull season.
The cryptocurrency market recently slipped into a bull phase, with the price of Bitcoin (BTC) hitting a new all-time high above $73,000 on March 14. However, the latest market uptrend, which began last October, has cooled, with most crypto assets seeing double-digit losses over the past month.
Nonetheless, most market analysts have presented the current downturn, which has triggered a 12% collapse in Bitcoinâ€™s price in the last month, as an opportunity for investors to augment their bags before the market witnesses another phase of price upswings.
Amid this prevalent sentiment, the uncertainty revolves around the cryptocurrencies worth betting on. While multiple market watchers have called attention to the most prominent altcoins, this article spotlights some of the lesser known ones trading under the $1 mark but showing potential to shine during the bull season.
The Graph (GRT) functions as a decentralized protocol within the blockchain scene, indexing and organizing data to enable the creation of open APIs, termed subgraphs. Developers utilize GraphQL to query these subgraphs for indexed data on the network.
In one of its recent bullish developments, The Graph introduced the Sunrise Upgrade Program, featuring a reward pool of 4 million GRT.

Santiment data reveals an additional 11,680 holders since January, surpassing 160,000 total holders and reaching 161,880 at last check. Concurrently, whale addresses, holding between 10 million and 100 million GRT, have accumulated over 200 million tokens since late February.
This positive momentum reflects growing investor confidence and substantial demand for the token, with GRTâ€™s performance in the current bull market exhibiting remarkable growth. It soared 504% from the August low of $0.0817 to a two-year peak of $0.4940 in March.
Current statistics show a 44% year-over-year increase in GRTâ€™s price. Despite a current trade value of $0.2654, representing a 46% decrease from the annual high, The Graphâ€™s resilience above the 200-day EMA ($0.2387) and its pursuit of significant resistance levels suggests a potential continuation of its upward trajectory.
TokenFi (TOKEN) is a pioneering entity within the Floki ecosystem for real-world assets tokenization. The platform boasts an intuitive interface, enabling the generation and tokenization of assets without the need for programming expertise.
As a participant in an expanding sector estimated to attain a $16 trillion valuation by 2030, TokenFi is poised to emerge as a dominant player in the realm of asset tokenization. Ripple, a prominent blockchain payment company based in San Francisco, is also exploring opportunities within this burgeoning market.
TokenFi has witnessed a notable uptick in investor confidence. An infusion of $10 million by DWF Labs into TokenFiâ€™s TOKEN for the advancement of AI-driven offerings triggered a 50% appreciation in its market price, culminating in a record peak.
Reflecting on its market performance, TokenFiâ€™s TOKEN has demonstrated impressive growth since its launch last October. Its value surged 642% from the start of January to a peak of $0.2464 on March 26. With its current price at $0.0950, TOKEN has appreciated by 186% this year, positioning itself to capitalize on the anticipated market surge for further growth.
Ankr (ANKR) is a Web3 infrastructure provider delivering development tools for blockchain technology. It offers multi-chain staking, node deployment, and API management services.
ANKR rose to the top validator spot on Binance Smart Chain three years ago, which significantly increased its value and visibility. This growth was backed by stronger fundamentals, new partnerships, and integrations with major blockchain networks.
Ankrâ€™s partnerships with Microsoft and Tencent Cloud and its service collaboration with Storj have further solidified its market position.
In the current bull run, ANKR has shown positive growth trends. It is currently priced at $0.0447, marking a 56.4% increase this year, despite a 35% drop from the April 1 high of $0.0688. ANKR remains above its 200-day EMA of $0.0379, and with a low CCI of -116, it appears to be undervalued.
Sei (SEI) is a layer-1 blockchain crafted for trading platforms. It is known for its rapid transaction speeds due to a distinctive parallel architecture that enables simultaneous processing across various nodes.
Last April, the team garnered a $30 million investment to develop the blockchain. Seiâ€™s infrastructure is adaptable, supporting a plethora of applications, including decentralized exchanges, NFT marketplaces, and gaming platforms, establishing itself as a multifaceted framework.
In February, Seiâ€™s Devnet received a significant update, making it compatible with the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM). Interestingly, according to Santiment data, the project has seen a consistent increase in development activities.
On its launch in August, the SEI token secured listings on major exchanges such as Binance, KuCoin, and Bybit, enhancing its market presence. Currently trading for $0.5225 with a market cap surpassing $1.4 billion, SEI has soared by 6,420% since launch and is on track for further gains.
In March, SEI reached a new all-time high alongside Bitcoin, achieving the $0.8 level and aiming for the sought-after $1 milestone. Despite the recent market downturn, it has maintained its value above $0.5, and with an RSI of 39.90, there could be room for more growth.
Harmony (ONE) is a blockchain platform that streamlines the development and operation of decentralized applications (DApps). It utilizes sharding to scale effectively, ensuring swift transactions with minimal delay.
Harmony has been on an upward trajectory with its recent announcement of a $300 million ecosystem fund. This fund is set to entice developers and bolster the establishment of decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) within its network.
The ONE token plays a crucial role in the network, used for staking, transaction fees, and governance. The token has seen a robust performance in the ongoing bull market.
Kicking off the year at $0.0187, ONE surged 112% to a two-year peak of $0.0396 in March. Harmony has a history of significant growth, having soared 8,862% from $0.00424 in January 2021 to an all-time high of $0.38 in October of the same year. It is poised to continue this positive trend in the current market upswing.
