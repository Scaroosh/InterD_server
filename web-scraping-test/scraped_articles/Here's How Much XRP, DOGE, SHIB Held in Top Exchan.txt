Prominent crypto derivatives exchange Bybit based in Dubai has released its 10th reserve certificate, issuing it for May 2024 (the time stamp on the wallets was for 4.00 a.m. UTC on that day).
This information was shared by Chinese cryptocurrency journalist and blogger Colin Wu on his official X account.
This reserve certificate was published as part of the “proof-of-reserves” initiative implemented by centralized crypto exchanges after the FTX platform crashed in November 2021, pushing the Bitcoin price way down, along with the rest of the cryptocurrency market.
According to this report, Bybit currently holds 45,000 BTC; 317,434 ETH and 2,669,466,361 USDT. The Bitcoin reserves have seen a substantial increase by 580 BTC compared to April. The Ethereum stash held on the platform has dropped by 8.57% (the equivalent of 29,700 ETH). As for USDT, this crypto stash has increased by 13.32% - that is an additional 313 million dollar-backed stablecoins. Those are assets that Bybit holds on behalf of its users, not counting coins belonging to the exchange itself.
