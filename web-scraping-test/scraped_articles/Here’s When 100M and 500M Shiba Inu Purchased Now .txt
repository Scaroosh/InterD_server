Article Title: Here’s When 100M and 500M Shiba Inu Purchased Now Will be Worth $1M and $10M

Shiba Inu investors could see their 100 million and 500 million SHIB holdings skyrocket to $1 million and $10 million if Shiba Inu hits price levels beyond $0.002.
The crypto market is gearing up for an imminent uptrend, but prices remain down at the reporting time due to a recent resurgence of bearish pressure. With Bitcoin (BTC) currently witnessing a 3.7% decline over the last 24 hours, altcoins, including Shiba Inu, have recorded similar price drops.
SHIB has shed off most of the gains it garnered earlier this month, now up by a meager 0.18% on the monthly timeframe. This follows a 27.16% collapse in April. Nonetheless, market participants see this downturn as an opportunity to purchase more assets at discounted prices before the expected upsurge.
Data from Santiment shows that addresses holding between 100,000 and 1 million Shiba Inu have continued to augment their balances, purchasing 10.1 billion SHIB since March 1. In addition, those holding at least 1 billion tokens procured 3.86 trillion SHIB between Feb. 24 and March 23.
Behind this accumulation spree is optimism that Shiba Inu would reach pivotal price targets, with investors anticipating an appropriate price rally that could put them in the millionaire club. As a result, we recently evaluated the condition necessary for investments holding 100 million and 500 million to be worth $1 million and $10 million.
To purchase 100 million Shiba Inu at the current price, an investor would need to commit $2,248 dollars. For these assets to reach a worth of $1 million, Shiba Inu must skyrocket to $0.01, a price point that represents a 44,383% increase from SHIB’s current value.
Moreover, the worth of these 100 million SHIB tokens would pump to $10 million if Shiba Inu is able to secure a price around the $0.1 territory. SHIB would have to spike by 444,739% to reach this price. While these price points seem impossible, crypto prediction platform Telegaon forecasts that SHIB could hit $0.01 between 2030 and 2040 and reach $0.1 in 2050.
Meanwhile, investors looking to sit on $1 million or $10 million at a lower price would need to purchase more SHIB tokens at the current price. For those eyeing 500 million tokens, an initial investment amount of $11,240 is required.
If Shiba Inu reaches the $0.002 price target, the value of these 500 million SHIB tokens will hit $1 million, marking an 8,796% increase from its current value. However, to hold $10 million, investors with this balance would have to see SHIB reach the $0.01 price.
These evaluations present an attractive buy opportunity for Shiba Inu investors looking to make a fortune. However, it is important to note that these are mere assessments, and Shiba Inu might never reach the prices presented. As a result, this should not serve as investment advice.
