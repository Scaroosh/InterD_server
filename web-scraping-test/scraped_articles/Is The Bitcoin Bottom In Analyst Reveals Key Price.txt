Article Title: Is The Bitcoin Bottom In Analyst Reveals Key Price Levels To Watch

Article Text:
In his latest technical analysis, veteran crypto analyst Christopher Inks offers a detailed look at the current Bitcoin market structure through a comprehensive chart analysis. The chart, recently shared on X, shows Bitcoin’s price movements alongside several key technical indicators and levels that could signal a potential reversal from its bearish trend.
The analyst illustrates Bitcoin’s price action with daily candlesticks over the past few months, pinpointing significant support (S1, S2) and resistance (R1, R2) levels. As of press time, Bitcoin traded at around the $63,000 mark, encapsulated by two descending trend lines which represent a bearish market structure.

“We still want to see a breakout above the noted level to signal a break in the bearish market structure that began at the ATH,” Inks stated. This level is of paramount importance because it serves as a junction of multiple technical elements: the daily pivot point, the upper descending green resistance line, and the two-month range equilibrium.
