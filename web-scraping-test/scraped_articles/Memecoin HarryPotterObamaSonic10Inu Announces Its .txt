Article Text:
Memcoin HarryPotterObamaSonic10Inu (BITCOIN) announced the launch of its blockchain based on AltLayer and EigenDA, EigenLayer. On May 14th, the meme coin completes its first year. Although details have not been revealed, a post on X states that this new blockchain will be a “memechain.” According to data aggregator CoinGecko, BITCOIN is up 8.5% since the announcement, 4% in the last 24 hours, and 1,140% since its inception. However, memcoin is almost 60% below its all-time high at the time of writing.
The decision comes after Shiba Inu (SHIB) memcoin raised $12 million from companies including Mechanism Capital, Animoca Brands, DWF Ventures and Polygon Ventures, with plans to launch its own layer 3 blockchain. Cypher Capital Chairman Bill Qian stated that the Shiba Inu blockchain is “set to power up blockchain real-world utility.”
Berachain recently raised $100 million to develop its layer 1 blockchain. The blockchain originated from Bong Bears, a collection of NFT projects that has created an active community. This community subsequently developed Berachain.
