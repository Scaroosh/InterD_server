Article Title: Memecoin Jeo Boden Skyrockets After Donald Trump’s Public Statement

Article Text:
Jeo Boden (BODEN), a memecoin created from a misspelling of U.S. President Joe Biden’s name, skyrocketed in the past 24 hours after presidential candidate Donald Trump recognized the digital asset and talked about it in a public appearance.
As per the data from CoinGecko, the price of the meme coin jumped almost 10% in the past 24 hours, with a 20.65% surge in trading volume. The market capitalization of the memecoin stands at $251 million.
Notably, former US President Trump hosted the Trump Cards NFT Gala for holders of the digital collection pioneered by the billionaire at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida. At the event, the reality TV star was asked about the BODEN meme coin by a fan, who described the token to him.
“I don’t like that investment,” Trump said in response to the sudden question asked by the fan. It is important to note that the meme coin peaked at $0.426 in the past 24 hours and, at the time of writing, is trading at $0.3527.

In a recent statement, Trump hinted at support for Bitcoin (BTC) and cryptocurrencies, which came as a surprise for the digital asset community since the billionaire is a Republican who is known to be staunch critic of virtual currencies. Additionally, Trump is also a strong critic of the central bank digital currency (CBDC) and has vowed to put an end to the Federal Reserve’s plans for a digital dollar if elected president.
