Leading the charge in the cryptocurrency realm, NiceHash, the premier hashrate marketplace, has unveiled plans for the inaugural Bitcoin conference in Maribor. Dubbed NiceHashX, the event is slated to take place on November 8 and 9, marking a significant milestone for the Slovenian-based company, which was founded by two local students in 2014.
Titled the ‘Bitcoin Conference on the Sunny Side of the Alps,’ NiceHashX aims to spotlight Maribor and Slovenia as burgeoning hubs for Bitcoin adoption within Europe. With over 1,000 businesses across the country already accepting Bitcoin payments, the conference seeks to shed light on the vibrant ecosystem thriving in the region. Notably, a dedicated stage will showcase various Maribor-based enterprises actively leveraging blockchain technology.
Vladimir Hozjan, CEO of NiceHash, expressed enthusiasm for the event, stating, “We are delighted to welcome the world to discover how Slovenia is leading the way in European Bitcoin adoption. With 10 years of experience in this industry, we have witnessed phenomenal growth in the interest of using Bitcoin, here in Maribor and around the country. Join us as we celebrate, and witness Bitcoin in its purest form, used by everyday people, alongside some of the brightest speakers in the industry.”
The conference boasts an impressive lineup of speakers, including renowned figures such as Saifedean Ammous, author of The Bitcoin Standard, and Jameson Lopp, CTO of CASA. Discussions will span topics ranging from European Bitcoin adoption and regulation to the evolving landscape of mining and energy consumption.
In addition to the main conference proceedings, attendees can anticipate an engaging expo area, multiple stages hosting diverse discussions, and an array of side events, including an exclusive after-party featuring a VIP dinner and live music. Moreover, NiceHash will showcase its newly launched Bitcoin payment solution, aimed at facilitating seamless transactions with local merchants.
Nestled amidst the picturesque Pohorje Mountains, Maribor offers a scenic backdrop for the conference, complemented by its rich cultural heritage and welcoming atmosphere. Recognized as the European Capital of Culture in 2012, Maribor is poised to captivate visitors with its architectural marvels and quaint cafes.
Despite being a relatively overlooked player in the European crypto scene, Slovenia boasts the second-largest number of blockchain startups after Switzerland. The country’s high Bitcoin adoption rate per capita is evidenced by the proliferation of Bitcoin-friendly establishments, including restaurants, hotels, and supermarkets.
As NiceHash continues to spearhead innovation in the cryptocurrency mining industry, the NiceHashX conference marks a significant milestone in showcasing Maribor’s emergence as a thriving center for Bitcoin enthusiasts and industry stakeholders alike. With its scenic allure and burgeoning crypto ecosystem, Maribor is poised to leave an indelible mark on the global cryptocurrency landscape.
