Notcoin is a web3 gaming project launched on Jan. 1 within the The Open Network (TON) ecosystem. It works as a mini-application inside the Telegram messenger and allows users to receive coins with a simple tap on the phone screen. Earnings can be increased through several additional activities.
Before this, the Notcoin project team announced that 5% of the token’s total supply would be divided between community members and cryptocurrency exchange clients.
One billion NOT was allocated for users of the wallet bot within Telegram, with the campaign set to end on May 25.

The team also said that NOT will be available to all starting on May 16. Users can sell the asset on the P2P market or exchange the crypto for Toncoin (TON), USDT, or Bitcoin (BTC). In addition, NOT can be sent to the Telegram contacts and used for payments.
Last week, the Notcoin team announced NOT’s listing. The OKX crypto exchange added NOT to the Jumpstart marketplace’s launchpad. From May 13 to May 16, traders can earn Notcoin by staking TON.
