In a separate yet related transaction on April 10, the same whale deposited multiple tokens on Binance to take profits. This whale deposited 182.4 billion $PEPE worth $1.24 million, 351,520 $CAKE valued at $1.31 million, 1.88 million $MANA worth $1.11 million, and 1.83 million $SAND valued at $1.09 million.

Since April 13, the PEPE token has shown a bullish trend on the daily chart, with the price range tool indicating a 155.62% increase. During this period, PEPE has taken out old highs and retained old lows, demonstrating strong upward momentum. As of press time, PEPE is nearing a critical resistance level at $0.00001101, a level last reached on March 14.

Should the bullish trend continue, PEPE is expected to surpass this resistance level, potentially reaching higher targets, including its all-time high of $0.00002. However, if PEPE fails to break this level, prices could decline, aiming to challenge the 78.6% Fibonacci retracement level.
This would lead to a support level around the 61.8% Fibonacci level before attempting another bull run. If this support is breached, PEPE could fall further, potentially reaching the May low.

Technically, the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) indicator is moving vertically, positioned at 0.00000068, signaling a bullish trajectory in the short term. Moreover, the MACD line trading above the signal line indicates a strengthening bullish sentiment for PEPE, with potential price increases. Additionally, the MACD histogram shows widening green bars above the zero line, further supporting the bullish momentum.

In tandem, the Relative Strength Index (RSI) trades vertically in overbought conditions, positioned at 71.44. This suggests that PEPE may be approaching an overvalued point, potentially leading to a price correction in the short term. However, the RSI line moving above the signal line indicates there may still be room for growth before a significant pullback occurs.
