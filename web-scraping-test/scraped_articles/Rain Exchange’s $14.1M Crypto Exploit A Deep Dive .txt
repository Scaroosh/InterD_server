On-chain analyst ZachXBT reports a potential exploit on Rain cryptocurrency exchange, with suspicious outflows amounting to approximately $14.1 million. The analyst also alleges that North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered $200 million worth of cryptocurrency.
Rain cryptocurrency exchange experienced a potential exploit on April 29, which transferred approximately $14.1 million worth of various cryptocurrencies to a new wallet under suspicious circumstances, according to a May 13 report from on-chain analyst ZachXBT. The exploit involved suspicious outflows from Rain’s Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), Solana (SOL), and XRP wallets. Funds from these wallets were swiftly transferred to instant exchanges, exchanged for Bitcoin and Ethereum, and then transferred to two addresses on the Bitcoin and Ethereum networks.
The Ethereum address, with the ending suffix “6c28,” currently holds approximately 1,881 ETH, valued at $5.5 million. Meanwhile, the Bitcoin address ending in “prp2” holds 137.9 BTC, valued at $8.6 million. Arkham Intelligence data reveals that the Ethereum destination address received its funds from an address ending in “d609,” which, in turn, received the funds from various Bitgo multi-signature wallets. Although these wallets have not been explicitly identified as belonging to Rain, they were involved in sending over 590 ETH ($1.7 million), approximately 20 billion Shiba Inu ($481,000), 12,500 Chainlink ($169,000), $240,000 Tether (USDT), and $500,000 USD Coin (USDC). These tokens were promptly swapped for ETH on Uniswap.
In recent posts, ZachXBT has made other substantial claims, including allegations that North Korea’s Lazarus Group laundered $200 million worth of cryptocurrency into fiat currency over a four-year period. According to ZachXBT’s analysis, at least $44 million worth of stolen crypto has been laundered through Paxful and Noones, utilizing two usernames, “EasyGoatfish351” and “FairJunco470,” which exhibited deposits and trading volumes corresponding to the stolen funds.
The crypto industry continues to face significant security challenges, with investors losing $2 billion to hacks and exploits last year, and an additional $333 million stolen in the first quarter of this year. The alleged exploit on Rain exchange and the claims against the Lazarus Group highlight the need for improved security measures and regulatory oversight in the crypto space.
