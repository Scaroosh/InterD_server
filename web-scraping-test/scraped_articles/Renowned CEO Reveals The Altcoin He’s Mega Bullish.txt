Article Title: Renowned CEO Reveals The Altcoin Heâ€™s Mega Bullish On, In Addition To Bitcoin And Ethereum

Article Text:
Viska Digital CEO Dadi Kristjansson recently shared his views on the current state of the cryptocurrency market in a conversation with Coinbase International.
Kristjansson stated that there is a bullish trend on Ethereum (ETH), Bitcoin (BTC) and Solana (SOL) compared to the US dollar.
Kristjansson believes the market is currently underestimating Solana's potential. He expects to see an increase in investment flows into SOL, attracted by the flexibility, speed and cost-effectiveness of the Solana network.
The CEO also touched on Ethereum's inflation rate, which continues to be quite low. Viska Digital's research team believes the market has underpriced the likelihood of an eventual ETH ETF approval.
Following the recent surge in BTC prices, Viska Digital's trading desk sees $60,000 as an important support level for Bitcoin. They believe that Bitcoin could reach an all-time high if it rises decisively above $67,000.
In terms of investment flows, ETFs have returned to net inflows over the past few days following the Fed's dovish comments. Grayscale saw its first two daily entries since converting to an ETF, indicating that the rotation away from GBTC has cooled.
