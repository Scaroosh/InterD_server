Article Title: Revolut X, New Cryptocurrency Exchange Platform, to List Dash

Article Text:
The Dash community has revealed on social media that the coin will be included in the trading options on Revolut X, the new cryptocurrency exchange platform by Revolut. This development expands Dash’s reach to Revolut’s rapidly growing user base. Revolut X, a standalone web app separate from Revolut’s main banking app, is designed to provide users with a dedicated platform for cryptocurrency trading. The addition of Dash to this platform underscores Revolut X’s commitment to offering a wide range of trading options to its users. This news comes after Dash faced the risk of delisting from exchanges due to its perception as a privacy coin. However, Dash developers have pushed back against this label, emphasizing that Dash’s privacy functionality is no greater than Bitcoin’s.
