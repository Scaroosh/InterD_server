Revolut's newest platform will be available to UK-based users who possess a Revolut retail account, and existing clients can seamlessly access the platform using their login credentials. Moreover, users can execute transactions between Revolut X and their Revolut accounts without incurring additional fees or limitations.
The launch of Revolut X follows the parent company's recent initiatives in the crypto sphere. Earlier, Revolut partnered with MetaMask to release Revolut Ramp. This integration facilitates the purchase of cryptocurrencies directly within user wallets, streamlining the onboarding process for crypto enthusiasts.
