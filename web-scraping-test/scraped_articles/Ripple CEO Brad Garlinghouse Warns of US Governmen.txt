Recent revelations regarding Tether's alleged use by terrorist organizations and individuals in US-sanctioned countries have attracted the attention of US authorities. In April, US Treasury Deputy Secretary Adewale Adeyemo highlighted concerns about Russia's utilization of USDT and alternative payment methods to circumvent sanctions during testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.
Meanwhile, Ripple has unveiled plans to introduce its own stablecoin, pegged 1:1 to the US dollar on the XRP Ledger. With the stablecoin market currently valued at $150 billion, Ripple anticipates significant growth, projecting a value of $2.8 trillion by 2028. Garlinghouse's remarks underscore the evolving regulatory landscape surrounding stablecoins and the broader implications for the cryptocurrency industry as authorities increase their scrutiny and oversight.
