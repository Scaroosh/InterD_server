Article Title: SOL Price Regains Strength, Can Solana Reclaim $150 and Continue Higher

Article Text:
Solana started a fresh increase above the $142 resistance. SOL price is up nearly 8% and might continue to rise if it clears the $150 resistance.
Solana price formed a support base near the $138 level and started a fresh increase. SOL outperformed Bitcoin and Ethereum and moved into a positive zone above the $144 level.
There was a break above a key bearish trend line with resistance at $144 on the 4-hour chart of the SOL/USD pair. The pair even cleared the 50% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $154.40 swing high to the $138.00 low.
However, the bears are active near the key hurdle at $150. Solana is now trading above $145 and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours). Immediate resistance is near the $150 level or the 76.4% Fib retracement level of the downward wave from the $154.40 swing high to the $138.00 low.

The next major resistance is near the $155 level. A successful close above the $155 resistance could set the pace for another major increase. The next key resistance is near $162. Any more gains might send the price toward the $175 level.
If SOL fails to rally above the $150 resistance, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $146 level and the 100 simple moving average (4 hours).
The first major support is near the $142 level, below which the price could test $138. If there is a close below the $138 support, the price could decline toward the $125 support in the near term.
