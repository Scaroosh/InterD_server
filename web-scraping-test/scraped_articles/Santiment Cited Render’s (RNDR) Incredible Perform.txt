Article Title: Santiment Cited Renderâ€™s (RNDR) Incredible Performance as an Example Names 4 Other Altcoins to Watch Out For

Article Text:
Cryptocurrency analysis company Santiment announced in its latest analysis that altcoins in the field of artificial intelligence continue their rise.
The company cited the Render (RNDR) altcoin as an example. RNDR has increased by 50% in the last week.
However, Santiment analysts drew attention to some altcoins in the same area with the rise in Render. According to analysts, RNDR is currently one of the most trending altcoins with an increasing mention rate on social media networks.
Analysts said that cryptocurrency users can also closely follow the altcoins AIOZ Network (AIOZ), Turbo (TURBO), Cirus Foundation (CIRUS) and DeriProtocol (DERI).
This interest in the field of artificial intelligence has also shown its impact specifically in Nvidia, the largest artificial intelligence-themed company. The company, known for its incredible rises recently, managed to gain more than 6% in value in the last 5 days. Nvidia has historically been a company that has been in the spotlight with its performance against Bitcoin. However, the company became even more famous as the field of artificial intelligence became popular after the boom of OpenAI.
