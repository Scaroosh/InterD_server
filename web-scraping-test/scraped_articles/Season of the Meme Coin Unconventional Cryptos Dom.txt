Article Text:
Over the past 90 days, bitcoin has appreciated by 23.4%. However, eight other cryptocurrencies have demonstrated significantly larger gains, each recording triple-digit increases over the same period.
Statistics from the past week show lackluster performances for cryptocurrencies against the U.S. dollar. Yet, over the past 90 days, various digital assets have experienced substantial increases against the greenback. Two meme coins—pepe (PEPE) and dogwifhat (WIF)—have both escalated by 705% and 692.3%, respectively, over the last three months.
The third biggest gainer of the season was floki (FLOKI), which climbed 422.88% against the U.S. dollar. The decentralized storage network Arweave’s token AR has ascended by 336.2%, while the artificial intelligence (AI)-focused coin FET advanced by 223.1%. Another meme coin, shiba inu (SHIB), achieved a 134.4% increase over the past 90 days.
Additionally, three-month metrics reveal that render (RNDR) experienced a 119.4% rise. NEAR, rising by 113.3%, was the last among the eight to record triple-digit gains against the greenback. THETA (+84.3%), BNB (+82.1%), FTM (+76.6%), DOGE (+72.9), GRT (+60%), and BCH (+59.5%) each posted double-digit increases.
MNT, LEO, CRO, HBAR, MKR, SOL, and BTC all saw gains ranging from 23% to 46%. In the fleeting 90-day whirlwind known as a crypto ‘season,’ triple-digit gains can become a norm, starkly contrasting the more measured tempo of traditional finance.
Over the distinct 90-day period, cryptocurrencies showcased explosive growth, particularly among meme coins and specialized tokens. While such surges are exceptional and not indicative of usual market behaviors, they highlight the dynamic essence of the crypto landscape, where fortunes can pivot on the latest trends or technological advancements like decentralized storage and AI.
