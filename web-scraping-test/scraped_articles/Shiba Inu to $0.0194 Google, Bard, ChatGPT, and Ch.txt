Article Title: Shiba Inu to $0.0194 Google, Bard, ChatGPT, and Changelly Predict Timelines

Article Text:
Multiple entities, including crypto exchange Changelly and AI chatbots Google Bard and ChatGPT, are projecting timelines for Shiba Inu to reach the $0.0194 level.
Shiba Inu is looking to reclaim the losses of the previous market downtrend, which triggered a 20% decline from April 23 to the end of the month. Overall, SHIB collapsed 27.16% in April. However, the month of May began with a bullish setup, with Shiba Inu already up 9.16% in less than a week.
Shiba Inu’s recovery campaign has been bolstered by the relief rally in the broader market, buoyed by Bitcoin’s (BTC) growing strength. SHIB recently tore through the 20-day EMA ($0.0002428) when it soared to a high of $0.00002632 on May 4. However, a resistance point at this level triggered a mild drop to the current value of $0.00002250.
Changelly recently presented an updated analysis of Shiba Inu’s current market position and possible price trajectory. The report confirmed that SHIB’s present market sentiments are 86% bullish, confirming that most investors remain confident in its recovery push.
They then projected that Shiba Inu would end the month of May at $0.00008503, slightly below its all-time high price of $0.00008845. This figure marks a 247% increase from SHIB’s current price, reflecting the predominant bullishness around the canine-themed cryptocurrency.
However, analysts at Changelly reserved the audacious price targets for much later dates. They predict Shiba Inu will erase one more zero in December 2027 and trade at $0.000102. They then expect the removal of an additional zero in January 2040 and one more in July 2040, projecting a maximum price of $0.0103 at this point.
The report further predicts that Shiba Inu could then reach the elusive $0.0194 price zone in July 2050, ten years after it clinches the $0.01 price level. For Shiba Inu to reach $0.0194, it would need to record a massive price surge of 79,083% from its present value.
We sought a hypothetical scenario from AI chatbots on when Shiba Inu could hit this target. Google Bard (now Gemini) suggested that SHIB could reach the $0.0194 value in 2040, essentially 16 years from now. It cited factors such as market volatility, gradual adoption, and technological advancements as possible catalysts.
Meanwhile, leveraging the JamesGPT prompt developed by Coinbase Director Conor Grogan, we asked ChatGPT to present the chances of SHIB hitting $0.0194 in 2050, as projected by Changelly, and in 2040, as predicted by Google Bard. The chatbot said there is a 75% chance that Shiba Inu could reach $0.0194 in 2050 and a 60% chance it would hit the target in 2040.
