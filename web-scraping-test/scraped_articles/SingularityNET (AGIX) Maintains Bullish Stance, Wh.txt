Article Text:
Amid a bullish surge in the crypto market, Bitcoin’s rebound from $56,500 to $65,223 has sparked notable optimism. The rally has been further fueled by heightened buying interest in US-listed Bitcoin ETFs, which has not only propelled Bitcoin but also boosted the altcoin market’s recovery from previous setbacks.
Among the standout performers in this market rally are AI-related tokens, displaying their agility in responding to shifting market dynamics with rapid movements. SingularityNET (AGIX), in particular, has garnered attention for its impressive 307% surge over the past six months, positioning it as one of the top cryptocurrencies to watch in 2024.
Traded above its monthly support of $1.16, SingularityNET is poised for further growth, especially with anticipation building around its upcoming AI token launch. Analysts believe SingularityNET could surpass its all-time high of $1.86 given the increased market attention it’s receiving.
In the last week alone, SingularityNET has recorded double-digit gains, presenting gainful opportunities for momentum traders. At the time of writing, AGIX is trading at $1.01 with a market cap of $1.29 billion. However, the daily trading volume of SingularityNET has dipped by 15% to $118 million, indicating some fluctuations in market activity.
