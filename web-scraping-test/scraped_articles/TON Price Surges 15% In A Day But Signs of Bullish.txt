The next key resistance is near $7.20. If the bulls remain in action above the $7.20 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $7.55 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $8.00 resistance.
If Toncoin price fails to clear the $6.90 resistance zone, it could start a downside correction. Initial support on the downside is near the $6.80 level and the parabolic curve, below which the price might test the 23.6% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $5.61 swing low to the $6.93 high.
The next major support is at $6.25 or the 50% Fib retracement level of the upward move from the $5.61 swing low to the $6.93 high. If there is a downside break and a close below the $6.25 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $6.00 support zone.
