According to The Block, Bybit announced that it will integrate Ethena Labs' (ENA) USDe stablecoin as a collateral asset.
Accordingly, Bybit will start trading in Bitcoin and Ethereum parities with the USDe stablecoin.
Guy Young, CEO and founder of Ethena Labs, said:
“Ethena's integration with Bybit is an important step in increasing use cases for USDe.
Offering USDe as collateral on Bybit, one of the most important derivatives platforms in the entire cryptocurrency world, will unlock the next wave of growth for USDe and further challenge the current stablecoin hegemony with a dedicated product designed specifically for crypto natives.”
After the news, ENA price became active.
