Article Title: Top Analyst Says Shiba Inu to Do 30X, Never Going to Zero

Article Text:
Widely followed analyst Davie Satoshi has argued that Shiba Inu is a prime candidate among crypto assets capable of rallying by 3,000% in this bull season.
Davie voiced this sentiment in a recent post on X while expressing his view on meme coins that will linger in the crypto scene and never fail. In particular, the analyst boldly asserted that Shiba Inu is one of the meme-based crypto assets he believes could achieve 10 to 30 times returns without ever dropping to zero.
The market pundit did not detail the reasons for his confidence in SHIB’s potential 30-fold increase and its resilience against dropping to zero. Nonetheless, this optimism is not unfounded, considering historical data.
As reported by The Crypto Basic, Shiba Inu’s performance post-Bitcoin’s last halving was nothing short of remarkable, with gains surpassing 800,000%. The returns are even more astonishing when traced from SHIB’s all-time low.
Furthermore, the meme-inspired Shiba Inu project is nearing its four-year birthday, and it continues to wield significant influence in the crypto scene. Shiba Inu survived the onslaught of the crypto market bears through 2022 and 2023. In particular, it consistently maintained a position among the top 20 most valuable cryptos.
Meanwhile, other meme coins that rocked the crypto market during the last run have either rug pulled or been relegated to a far-back seat. Interestingly, some meme coins launched in this early bull market phase have already been rug-pulled.
Essentially, Shiba Inu has proved its enduring capacity over the years. Furthermore, the Shiba Inu development team has been actively rolling out meaningful updates. They continue to form strategic partnerships that not only benefit SHIB but also have the potential to positively impact the broader tech sector.
Currently priced at $0.00002251, Davie’s prediction of SHIB experiencing a surge of 1,000% to 3,000% suggests he anticipates the Shiba Inu token could reach between $0.0002251 and $0.0006753 within the next year.
These price levels would represent new highs for Shiba Inu, surpassing its 2021 peak of $0.00008845. Moreover, Davie is not alone in his bullish outlook. Other analysts have also projected similar targets for Shiba Inu in the current bull market.
Notably, other meme coins featured on Davie’s list include the most valuable, Dogecoin (DOGE), and close contenders like PEPE and Dogwifhat (WIF). Meanwhile, Davie sees 30X potential in the newer contender in the meme coin landscape, Coq Inu (COQ).
