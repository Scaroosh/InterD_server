Article Title: Trump Says He's ‘Good’ With Crypto, Trashes Biden Meme Coin BODEN

Article Text:
US Presidential candidate Donald Trump came out in support of cryptocurrency during a special event for Trump NFT holders at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida late Wednesday.
The embattled former U.S. President and 2024 hopeful lamented that crypto companies are fleeing America.
“Crypto is moving out of the U.S. because of hostility towards crypto,” Trump said. “We’ll stop it because I don’t want that—if we’re going to embrace it, we have to let them be here.”

Trump’s apparently shifting views toward digital assets comes as analysts suggested on Tuesday that his winning the U.S. Presidential election in November would be good for Bitcoin. And he went after the incumbent, claiming Pres. Joe Biden is ignorant about crypto.
“Biden doesn’t know,” Trump told the crowd, also taking aim at the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.
“[Gary] Gensler is very much against it, the Democrats are very much against it,” Trump said. “But I’m good with it.”

In April, prices for Solana-based meme coins featuring caricatures of Trump and Biden surged, according to blockchain data from DexScreener. At one point, “Jeo Boden” and “Doland Tremp” had a market capitalization of $473 million and $83 million, respectively.
Hearing that a token making fun of Joe Biden was worth $240 million, Trump said: “That's a lot of money for a coin, I don't like that investment."
