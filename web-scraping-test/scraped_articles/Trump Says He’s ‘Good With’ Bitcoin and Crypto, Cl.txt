Article Title: Trump Says He’s ‘Good With’ Bitcoin and Crypto, Claims Biden Doesn’t Understand Digital Assets

Article Text:
Former President Donald Trump says he’s now “good with” Bitcoin and cryptocurrency.
At an event for Trump NFT holders at his Mar-a-Lago resort, Trump told attendees that regulatory hostility is driving crypto firms out of the US.
In a pitch to crypto advocates, Trump accused President Biden of being against an industry that he doesn’t understand.
“They are against it, the Biden – Biden doesn’t even know what it [is]…
He has no idea but look, Gensler is very much against it. The Democrats are very much against it. And I say this, a lot of people are very much for it. Probably a lot of people who are in this room.
And I’m fine with it. I want to make sure it’s good and solid, but I’m good with it. If you like crypto in any form – it comes in a lot of different forms – if you’re in favor of crypto you’d better vote for Trump.”

Trump also said he will accept donations to his campaign in Bitcoin and crypto.
During his presidency, Trump had a different take on the crypto industry, and criticized digital assets for their potential to facilitate unlawful behavior.
“I am not a fan of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, which are not money, and whose value is highly volatile and based on thin air. Unregulated Crypto Assets can facilitate unlawful behavior, including drug trade and other illegal activity.”
