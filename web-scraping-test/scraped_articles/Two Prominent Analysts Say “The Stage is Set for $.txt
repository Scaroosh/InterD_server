Article Title: Two Prominent Analysts Say “The Stage is Set for $100K in Bitcoin”, Explains Explain Their Reasons

Article Text:
Bitcoin, the world's largest cryptocurrency, is poised to begin its next rally and potentially reach $100,000, according to some financial analysts. This optimistic outlook is based on improving macro conditions and easing liquidity conditions for risky assets.
David Brickell, head of international distribution at institutional capital markets firm FRNT Financial, and Chris Mill, a former forex trader at the Bank of England, shared their views in their joint crypto newsletter “Connecting the Dots.” They believe that the market has been overly pessimistic lately and will move upwards again:
“The market is too hawkish and the risk weighting is low. “This hawkish positioning will need to be resolved in the coming weeks and will provide strong support to our markets.”
The duo cited three reasons why liquidity conditions are likely to improve in the near future:
The analyst concluded, “we were waiting for a spark that would take us out of the narrow range-related lethargy and overall sluggish price action for Bitcoin. “This spark was ignited between the FED and the US Treasury.” The combination of these factors is expected to put a cap on yields and the dollar, reversing what has become a strong drag for both Bitcoin and the broader risk market, according to analysts. As a result, the stage is set for Bitcoin's potential rise to $100,000, according to analysts.
