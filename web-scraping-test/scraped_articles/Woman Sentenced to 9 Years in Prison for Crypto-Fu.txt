Michelle Murphy, 58, from Bedford, Texas, has been sentenced to nine years in federal prison for attempting to hire a hitman using bitcoin to kill her boyfriendâ€™s lover. Charged in September 2023 and pleading guilty in December, Murphy used the dark web to orchestrate the crime, paying $10,510 in bitcoin. The transaction was traced through blockchain analysis after Murphy converted cash to BTC via an ATM. Although she admitted her actions post-arrest, it was revealed that the intended hitman might not have planned to execute the murder.
