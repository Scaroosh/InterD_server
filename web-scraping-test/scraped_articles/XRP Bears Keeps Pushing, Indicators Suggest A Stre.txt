The first key resistance is near $0.500. A close above the $0.500 resistance zone could spark a strong increase. The next key resistance is near $0.5085 and the 100-hourly Simple Moving Average. If the bulls remain in action above the $0.5085 resistance level, there could be a rally toward the $0.5250 resistance. Any more gains might send the price toward the $0.550 resistance.
If XRP fails to clear the $0.50 resistance zone, it could start another decline. Initial support on the downside is near the $0.4865 level.
The next major support is at $0.4780. If there is a downside break and a close below the $0.4780 level, the price might accelerate lower. In the stated case, the price could retest the $0.450 support zone.
