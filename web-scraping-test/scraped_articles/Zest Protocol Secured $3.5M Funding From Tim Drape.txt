The core focus of Zest Protocol is to facilitate Bitcoin lending through on-chain mechanisms, offering users the opportunity to generate yield from their BTC holdings without relying on traditional financial intermediaries.
This approach aligns with the ethos of decentralized finance (DeFi), where peer-to-peer transactions occur directly on the blockchain.
Zest Protocol leverages Bitcoin layer 2 technology by Stacks and the sBTC asset (pegged 1:1 to Bitcoin) to create a lending platform native to the Bitcoin network. However, users can deposit bitcoin using sBTC on the Stacks mainnet to participate in lending activities and earn passive income without selling their bitcoin holdings.
Tycho Onnasch, the founder of Zest Protocol, highlights the importance of Bitcoin layer 2 solutions like Stacks in unlocking decentralized finance (DeFi) opportunities for Bitcoin. Unlike Ethereum, which traditionally hosts DeFi applications, Bitcoin‚Äôs layer 1 has limitations that Stack technology overcomes.
Zest‚Äôs approach to lending aims for sustainability and maturity, distinguishing itself from previous high-yield offerings in the crypto industry.
